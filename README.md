# ezpbars itg tests

integration tests for ezpbars using [python](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

```sh
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Contributing

This project uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for linting
and the project is intended to test the other ezpbars repositories,
and thus itself does not have tests.
All tests must pass, but there's no specific code coverage requirement.
